# Cava (a.k.a policyBubbles)
Sparkling, fine bubbles. Cheaper than champagne, way better than prosecco.

## Setup
First, install gulp:

```
npm install -g gulp
```

Then run gulp on project's root to generate distributable project files under ``dist``:

```
gulp
```

##Disclaimer
Always remember to drink responsibly.
